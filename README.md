# MoviesFollowerKotlin

This is a remake of the last app I've made [MoviesFollower](https://github.com/Dhaia/MoviesFollower), the purpose of this project was to adapt with Kotlin and use the best practices.

# I've used:
- The MVVM architecture pattern.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
- **One activity**.
- A repository.
- Navigation Component(Navigation Graphs, SafeArgs in order to pass data between destinations, BottomNavigationView)
- Data binding.
- Kotlin coroutines.
- Retrofit for network calls.
- Room persistence library.
- Glide for loading images.
- The MoviesDb API.
